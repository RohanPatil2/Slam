🚀 AUTONOMOUS SLAM SYSTEM - READY TO RUN!
================================================================================

FIXED THE STAGE ERROR! Now it works!

TO RUN:
-------

cd ~/slam_uncertainty_ws
source install/setup.bash
./RUN_GMAPPING_SYSTEM.sh


WHAT HAPPENS:
-------------

✅ Stage window opens with cave map
✅ RViz opens with displays  
✅ Robot AUTOMATICALLY starts moving after 5 seconds
✅ Robot follows 80 pre-defined waypoints
✅ SLAM map builds in real-time
✅ Entropy heatmap shows RED → BLUE live
✅ NO MANUAL CONTROL NEEDED!


WHAT TO WATCH:
--------------

RViz Window - You'll see:
- Gray/black/white SLAM map building
- Color entropy overlay (RED = uncertain, BLUE = certain)
- Entropy gradually changing from RED to BLUE
- Live updates at 10 Hz

Stage Window - You'll see:
- Cave map (ground truth)
- Red robot moving automatically
- Laser scanner rays


DURATION:
---------

~20 minutes for full exploration
Robot stops automatically when done
Results saved to: ~/slam_uncertainty_ws/results/visualizations/


THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED:
---------------------------------

✅ Pre-fixed path (not random)
✅ Autonomous (not manual control)  
✅ Live entropy heatmap (the "entropy thing")
✅ Real SLAM mapping


JUST RUN IT AND WATCH! 🎬🤖
